# Random UUID Command Line App

This is a very simple go app to create random UUIDs, which I find myself needing all the time and opening a web browser tab and typing "random UUID" into Duck Duck Go to get one takes to long, so I made this. 
Minimal testing done on an older Intel-based MacBook. Use at your own risk, etc.
